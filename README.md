This is a practical work for the IRAC course in the Máster Universitario en Ingeniería de Telecomunicación, ETSIT-UPM.

Most of the code is based on the book Real-Time Communication with WebRTC, by Salvatore Loreto & Simon Pietro Romano. Some of the modifications are from my professors, while the interface improvements and some of the logic are mine. The original code can be found at:
